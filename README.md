# Motor Modelling Project

This project contains mathematical modeling of motor systems using Python and SymPy.

## Description

The project implements motor modeling equations including:
- Short-circuit coefficients analysis
- Clarke transformation
- dq0 coordinate transformations
- Voltage and flux calculations
- Differential equation solving for motor dynamics

## Files

- `motor_modelling.ipynb`: Main Jupyter notebook containing the motor modeling calculations and simulations

## Technologies Used

- Python
- SymPy (symbolic mathematics)
- NumPy (numerical computations)
- Matplotlib (plotting and visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install sympy numpy matplotlib jupyter
   ```
3. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook motor_modelling.ipynb
   ```

## Usage

The notebook contains step-by-step calculations for motor modeling including matrix transformations, differential equations, and plotting of results.

## Results

The project generates plots showing motor current responses over time, providing insights into motor behavior under different conditions.
